# Go-VMC

A versioned version of go-mc, golang library for (almost) everything for Minecraft.

Versioned repository is not supported by the Tnze, but if something is not right it is still his fault.

## Versions

Each "major" release is stuck in it's own major-versioned folder so you can use as many as you want at the same time just by importing every version you need.
